* Defender

[[./defender-game.png]]

This is a port of [[https://github.com/massung][Jeffrey Massung's]] example game [[https://github.com/massung/r-cade/blob/main/examples/defender.rkt][defender.rkt]] to Common Lisp.

This was a project to for me to learn Common Lisp and Raylib.

* Building

#+begin_src shell
  # Build
  sbcl --load release.lisp --eval '(sb-ext:exit)'

  # Run
  ./defender
#+end_src

* Hacking

#+begin_src shell
  sbcl --load dev.lisp

  # then connect with sly on port 4005
#+end_src
